Ststus update  --week04 (6.16)

Issue#4
I am still on first given issues, still on the beginning and reset the folder delay the step.
I still need to figure out the process of information consuming, maybe some docker.

Plan for next week:
1. Fix the issues of docker in older version (bin/yacs-build-development seems failed)
2. Re-start the Consumer development -- Need ask about developments.
3. Try to complete the issue, I am late on the deadline.
